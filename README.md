<h1>Small Library Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library#introduction">The Odin Project</a>.</h1>

Goal is to cement notions of Object-Oriented Programming, in particular Object Constructors :^) 

The hardest part was actually the CSS. I've learned a lot along the way (some overflow-wrap for the table to be responsive despite tables not being very responsive by nature passed a certain point / playing with background-blend-mode / a neat trick for having only the inner borders of the table appear / etc.).

Well, I'm not satisfied with the result though.

I do wonder where choosing a modal over the details HTML attribute, or a grid layout over the table would have brought me instead.
